# BootCampAssessment
Boot camp assigment at Cook System
For the following assignment, you are to create a program with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows for a user 
to select computer parts from a list and add them to a list representing the computer they wish to build.  In order to 
complete this assignment, you will utilize Swing, Window Builder, and JAXB.

Swing is a GUI framework that comprises Java objects that represents items displayed to a user.  Window Builder is a 
tool that allows you to “drag and drop” Swing components onto an editor, allowing you to organize the layout of your 
GUI on a presentation level instead of programmatically.

JAXB, Java Architecture for XML Binding, is a tool by which Java objects can be “marshalled” into XML documents and
“unmarshalled” back into Java objects.  You won't need to worry about how this happens for now, but you do need to
know how to annotate a Java class as being compatible with JAXB. This is done by putting the @XMLRootElement annotation
above the declaration of a class, i.e. before you declare “public class myClass.”.
